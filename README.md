# basic-automated-testing-framework-and-CI-CD-skeleton
Basic Automated Testing Framework and CI/CD Skeleton  A minimal project skeleton demonstrating how to integrate automated testing (using PyTest) into a Flask application and set up a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline. This foundation is fully customizable, so you can add more endpoints, tests, and advanced configurations as your project evolves.


# Basic Automated Testing Framework and CI/CD Skeleton

This repository contains a basic project skeleton for integrating an automated testing framework into a simple Flask application, along with a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions. It serves as a starting point to build more comprehensive testing suites and automate your development workflow.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to:
- Build a simple Flask web application.
- Write automated tests using PyTest.
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions to run tests automatically on code changes.
- Optionally containerize the application using Docker.

The skeleton is designed to be extendedâ€”feel free to add more functionalities, endpoints, or tests as required.

## Features

- **Flask Application:** A lightweight web server with a basic endpoint.
- **Automated Testing:** Unit and integration tests with PyTest.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions workflow triggers tests on every push or pull request.
- **Optional Dockerization:** Dockerfile included to containerize the project for consistent testing environments.
